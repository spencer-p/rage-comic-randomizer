# rage-comic-randomizer

This is a simple website that randomly displays a single [rage comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_comic). The comics were scraped with Python from the best of [Reddit's worst rage comics](https://www.reddit.com/r/f7u12_ham/). A random comic is displayed with pure JS.

I wrote this because the low quality of rage comics can often be entertaining. However, **please be warned that some of the comics are vulgar, not safe for work, or contain hate speech.**
